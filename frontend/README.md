TEMS Frontend (Vite + React)

Run locally (Windows cmd):

1. Open a terminal:

```cmd
cd "d:\Coding World\MyPractices\Ashu\temsv2\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. The app will open at the address shown by Vite (http://localhost:5173 by default). It expects the minimal backend at `http://localhost:4000`.

Notes:

- Environment variable VITE_API_URL can be used to change API base URL.
- This is a minimal MVP frontend: pages include Home, Events, Event Detail (with registration), Dashboard, Admin, Certificates.
